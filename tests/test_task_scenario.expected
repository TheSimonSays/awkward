Things that matter (but won't change anything): 4
  - find meaning in life (priority: 10)
  - pretend to be happy (priority: 9)
  - survive another day (priority: 10)
  - remember better times (priority: 9)

Things i somehow managed to do: 3
  - exist
  - forget old friends
  - ignore messages

Currently failing at:
  - pretend to be happy (P9)
  - survive another day (P10)
  - pretend sleep helps (P7)

High priority things i'm avoiding:
  - find meaning in life [P10]
  - pretend to be happy [P9]
  - contemplate void [P7]
  - survive another day [P10]
  - remember better times [P9]
  - pretend sleep helps [P7]

Things i gave up on: 2
  - find meaning in life (P10)
  - remember better times (P9)

Existential: 4 (questioning everything)
Daily: 2 (barely functioning)
Social: 3 (avoiding people)
Health: 1 (what's the point?)

Todo: 2 (probably won't do)
In Progress: 3 (barely)
Done: 3 (surprisingly)
Abandoned: 2 (gave up)
Total: 10 (too many)

Still trying to figure out:
  - contemplate void

Successfully avoided:
  - forget old friends
  - ignore messages
Currently pretending:
  - pretend to be happy

Completion rate: 3/10
High priority failures: 4
More important things undone than done
